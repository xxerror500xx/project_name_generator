# project_name_generator
This is a first rendition of a simplified random project name generator.

A sample-working of the application can be found [here](https://xxerror500xx.github.io/project_name_generator/). (it is not able to utilize the backend api from the github hosting so the sample word list is very short and the rating system does not record your ratings).

This application uses the following library's.

- Bootstrap v4 4.0.0-beta.2
- Jquery ver. 3.2.1
- and parts of the [rateit](https://github.com/gjunge/rateit.js) Jquery plugin. 

Just for fun.
